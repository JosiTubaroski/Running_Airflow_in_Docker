# Running Airflow in Docker

This quick-start guide will allow you to quickly get Airflow up and running with the CeleryExecutor in Docker

### Caution

This procedure can be useful learning and exploration. However, adapting it for use in real-world situations can be complicated. Making changes to this procedure will require specialized in Docker & Docker Compose, and the Airflow community may not be able to help you.

For that reason, we recommend using Kebernetes with the Official Airflow Community Helm Chart when you ready to run Airflow in production.

Before you Begin

This procedure assumes familiarity with Docker and Docker Compose. If you haven't worked with these tools before, you should take a moment to run throught the Docker Quick Start (especially the section on Docker Compose) so you are familiar with how they word.

Follow these steps to install the necessary tools, if you have not already done so.
